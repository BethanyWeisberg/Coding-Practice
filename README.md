# Coding Practice
Hello, welcome to my **Coding Practice** repository! Here I store programs and scripts that I have written for practicing **Python**.

In *Trippy Dancer*, I have written a program that replaces the either the red or the white pixels in one image (i.e. a dancer with a red dress and white backdrop) with the pixels of a second image (i.e. a tie-dye image), giving it a trippy look.
