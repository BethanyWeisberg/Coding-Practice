Hello, welcome to my **Coding Practice** repository! Here I store programs and scripts that I have written for practicing **Python**.

## Trippy Dancer

In *Trippy Dancer*, I have written a program that replaces the either the red or the white pixels in one image (i.e. a picture of a dancer with a red dress and white backdroo) with the pixels of a second image (i.e. a tie-dye image), giving it a trippy look (**Images 1 and 2**).

**Image 1**
